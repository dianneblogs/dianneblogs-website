    <p>I don’t know what your relationship experience looks like, but if you’re in a relationship right now – I’m praying it will work out (where both of you are fulfilled, not just the other person) and if it’s not meant to be, that you realize sooner than later.</p>

<p>If you’re not in a relationship right now, have gone through a painful break up – I pray that you will seek God’s love to fill you, I pray that you find someone who will love, care and know how important you really are. I also pray that in this season, you regain your self confidence and believe that you CAN and you WILL accomplish great things!</p>

<p>SO - Three weekends ago, I found out that my ex boyfriend (who I dated for 3 years) asked the love of his life’s hand in marriage. I am happy for them, I pray for a successful marriage, that they would enjoy this process together and beyond. I mean it.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>BUT – If I tell you I’m not hurt by this news, would you believe me?
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Of course I am. I am just as surprised as you are with my feelings. I’m aware that this moment was eventually going to happen. At first, I felt like crap for feeling “hurt” because 1. I’m with George and 2. I don’t want to rain on the couple’s parade.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>I felt hurt because I once cared and that’s okay.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When I found out, I was speechless and quite frankly freaking out because I wasn’t sure whether I should be happy, sad, resentful or angry. I reached out to my closest friends to somehow get their insight on how they felt (for me) because I was too lost to figure it out myself. I love these three to death! I am very grateful for them, for giving me their advice and love during my time of confusion. Love you K, JB and JH!!</p>

<p>Eventually, I knew a question about whether I should tell George would come up and it did.  Of my three closest friends in particular raised the question (because JB knew how I am when my feelings are all over the place):</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Are you going to tell George?
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>My first thought/answer was – NO and JB AGREED without hesitation. However, I didn’t follow through my concrete “NO”. Instead, I told George and I’m glad I did.</p>

<p>It was such a surreal and comforting moment for me to talk to George about it. Most people would be the Dianne the night before and not tell their S.O, but for me – George is someone I CARE SO MUCH ABOUT, he is someone I can talk to about ANYTHING, he is the perfect person to eliminate himself out of my life for a second and just understand where I’m coming from. He is my confidante and the most trustworthy person I’ve ever encountered. I love you, G!</p>

<p>George loved on me so much during this time. I felt so undeserving of him.</p>

<p>I feel that my conversation with George was very personal, but I also feel like this is something worth sharing to others who are struggling like I was.</p>

<p><em>BACKGROUND</em></p>

<p>During the three years of dating that guy, I managed to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>neglect my family and friends
forget who I was (loud, opinionated, down to earth, personable)
After our break-up, I was very confused and found myself:</p>
  </li>
  <li>wondering who I was
  if I can still repair my broken relationships with friends and family</li>
  <li>am I still worth loving despite my brokenness and the mess I’ve created for myself?</li>
  <li>will I ever bring myself to trust another person ever again?</li>
</ul>

<p>Fast-forward, George came into my life and put my wonders to rest and during this moment (about the engagement), he told me these things:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>“I don’t mean to sound insensitive, but I’d be worried if you didn’t feel the way you do right now”

“You’re okay, don’t worry about me. I can take it. You’re hurt and I want to be here for you”.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Not one bone in my body was pissed at George for saying this. As a matter of fact, it was really comforting to hear it. At the end of the day, who I was back then is not who I am today. I am grateful that God has put someone in my life who values me, loves me and put my worries aside. I am reminded through George that someone out there will value you. Someone out there will pursue you and not take you for granted. I am reminded that just because it didn’t work out with that one, that it wouldn’t work out with this one.</p>

<p>I am happy to tell you, that I am so blessed to be where I am today and to be with someone worth my time. It’s okay to hurt because you cared, but it’s not okay to continue to hurt about someone who was not worth your time.</p>

<p>Keep it easy,
Dianne</p>
