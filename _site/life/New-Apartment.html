  <article>
    <p>Happy Saturday Friends,</p>

<p>Today, I am giving you a sneak peek of our space. You’ll see in the pictures that we’re trying (I’m convincing G) that it’s a good idea to keep the space free of clutter and unnecessary things. We are working with a 1 bed, 1 bath apartment here.</p>

<p>First stop, kitchen. I’m a foodie and I love a nice kitchen. We almost didn’t move in to this apartment because the cabinets look so outdated with the old appliances. Somehow, G and I mutually agreed on getting newer appliances for $25/month more. I figured, I got half of what I really wanted and being in our 20s, that seemed reasonable.</p>

<p>Behind the double doors is a washer and a dryer. Right around that area is a space we haven’t truly thought of. We have juggled with the idea of making it into our dining room, but we really didn’t want to spend extra money for dining table and chairs. Plus, we are barely at the apartment at the same time, so a meal together is not entirely realistic. We also thought it might work just as the designated laundry area. We thought of putting a garment rack or anything laundry related, but since it’s right next to the kitchen, the clothes might end up smelling like food. Lastly, we thought we could just put extra kitchen storage. These cabinets don’t only look outdated, but are extremely tight with storage, it’s a little difficult to manage. What do you think? What would you do with an empty space next to the kitchen and laundry?</p>

<p>Oh, I swear, we’re replacing those bar stools. We only bought them for temporary seating, for an eating area. Super aware how short they are and I’m 5’1” which makes it extra difficult to reach haha.</p>

<img src="/assets/img/apartment/apt_kitchen02.jpg" alt="Kitchen02" class="img-responsive" />
<img src="/assets/img/apartment/apt_kitchen03.jpg" alt="Kitchen03" class="img-responsive" />
<img src="/assets/img/apartment/apt_kitchen04.jpg" alt="Kitchen04" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>Next stop, living room. This is my favorite space around the apartment. The living room is actually much larger than what you’re seeing, but we’ve transformed the other half into an office which you’ll see in the next slideshow. I love this space, it’s so open and the natural light that comes in is amazing (&amp; not to mention, good for our pockets too). We have two good sized windows and a sky light coming into this room. It definitely makes a world of a difference because it makes the space feel much bigger!</p>

<p>We are in the process of saving for a couch. I mainly want a sectional couch that can also be transformed into a bed for friends and family visiting. You guys, why are couches so expensive?</p>

<img src="/assets/img/apartment/apt_living02.jpg" alt="Living02" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>And here’s the other half of the living room! We’ve converted it into an office because we’re both students! Right now, there’s only one desk for us to share. We thought about having two desks, but buying one right now is just another unnecessary expense since we’re really not at the apartment together all the time! I love this office space. Like the living room, the natural lighting that comes into the place is amazing. The wall art are both a depiction of who we are as individuals, space for G and birds for me. Speaking of birds, those are drawn by my best friend’s sister! If you’re interested, check out her <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/JupiterIllustrations?ref=profile_shopname">Etsy shop</a>! We bought a 12×16 secretary bird (blue) and 12×16 peacock (pink).</p>

<img src="/assets/img/apartment/apt_living05.jpg" alt="Living05" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>Here, we have our bedroom. Bed frame and bed are both purchased from Amazon! Check out my other post about it »here«! The two side tables are from Overstock, it was a little over $100 for both. The TV actually used to be in the living room until G bought the one you just saw in the living from a Captain who had received new orders to move. Therefore, old TV moved into our bedroom and we’re thinking of getting a Roku or other live streaming devices so we can put the TV to use. Any recommendations for live streaming? Lantern above the bed is from Target and the frame above the bed is from Hobby Lobby. Special thanks to one of my best friends, Emmy for helping me pick out the art and lantern and helping me put it up!</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed this update and if you have any ideas/recommendations on what we can do to make our apartment feel more inviting and oh, that kitchen/laundry area, I would love that!</p>

<p>Thanks again for reading!</p>
