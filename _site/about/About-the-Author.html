    <p><em>Are you in college? Are you struggling through life? Are you bored? Well, same.</em></p>

<p><strong>Welcome to Dianne Blogs: a mixture of everything and in betweens of my life.</strong></p>

<p>When I started this blog, I was a senior in high school. Being the overachiever, curious human being that I am, I explored the realms of blogging. For awhile, I did not know what to write about, then it dawned on me: I love sharing my life and experiences with others. On second thought, that’s not very secure as some might have secret agendas to extract as much possible information from me, but at the same time, what the heck, I’ve been on the internet long enough, there are probably a lot of information about me I don’t even know about.</p>

<p>So here we are, at Dianneblogs. Before I tell you more, my <em>[middle]</em> name is <strong>Dianne</strong>. Nice to meet you and I’m so glad you are here!</p>

<p>I started Dianneblogs with no clear focus. Figures. Then, I got into college and I <strong>succeeded</strong>, <strong>failed</strong> and <strong>cried a lot.</strong> On top of college, I’ve been <strong>happy</strong>, I’ve been <strong>hurt</strong> and I’ve had such a hard time sticking with <strong>faith</strong>. For some reason, fear always won.</p>

<p><em>Sound familiar?</em></p>

<p>Dianneblogs, is your internet getaway, where you’ll find posts about random topics, but I’ll try my best to focus most on <strong>college, faith, all things life and travel</strong>. And just a heads up, posts on Dianneblogs are more on a personal level.</p>

<p>I’ve been told that I’m most happy when I help someone. Whether that’s helping them just by listening, talking or lifting heavy things to move from one place to another. I love people, I really do and I’ve always had the heart to help someone in need (unless you’re taking advantage, then you’re out of luck).</p>

<p><em>That’s my heart right there, but I guess you also need to know/verify why I can and would write such things on my blog.</em></p>

<p><em>———————————————————————————————————-</em></p>

<h2 id="to-cover-college-i-am-a-college-student-studying-computer-science">To cover college, I am a college student, studying Computer Science.</h2>
<p>I get it, college is so hard! I’ve wanted to give up numerous times, I’ve shed way too many tears to count, I’ve had victories and I’ve definitely learned. All I know is, college is not for everyone. I still think it’s not for me, but here I am, struggling my way through it because I really want to have something that’s mine. A degree I’m going to earn for myself, not something someone has earned and given me. It’s a pride thing, but I think it’s a good type of pride thing.</p>

<h2 id="to-cover-faith-i-am-a-christian">To cover faith, I am a Christian.</h2>
<p>I have been saved since 2012, but I’ve known about Jesus since my first breath. I was raised Catholic in the Philippines, attended a Protestant university and had a muslim driver. I don’t judge because at the end of the day, it’s the heart of a person that matters - not their label. You’re probably going to read about my struggles because being a “Christian” in college is so hard too. Being a “Christian” in this day is just so dang difficult and I don’t know why (or maybe I do and just don’t want to believe it?). I don’t want you to think that I’m like a nun or something of that sort because I’ve probably screwed up more than I’d like to admit, but that’s what it takes to be human who exercises choice.</p>

<h2 id="to-cover-travel-ive-lived-in-the-philippines-visited-scandinavia-spain-and-visited-16-states">To cover travel, I’ve lived in the Philippines, visited Scandinavia, Spain and visited 16 states.</h2>
<p>I am really into traveling. I don’t travel as much as I used to, but for being 22 I’ve traveled to amazing places! I’ll share as much as I can!</p>

<h2 id="and-all-things-life">And all things life</h2>
<p>This should cover my life. So if you really want to get personal, head over to that category. This will range from relationships to milestones and sometimes a cry for help.</p>

<p><em>I really hope you stick around or come back another day. But most of all, I really hope I can be your friend in your time of need whether that would be boredom or if you’re really struggling.</em></p>

<p><em>Don’t hesitate to connect with me and don’t just connect - I’d love for us to really become friends, so let’s make sure to talk to each other. It takes two to tango, so don’t hesitate to reach out!</em></p>

<p><em>If you want to email, it’s divinusvenia@gmail.com or find @dianneblogs on twitter, instagram or pinterest and message me!</em></p>

<p><em>With that being said, I hope you now have a better understanding of what this blog is all about. Thanks for visiting!!</em></p>

<p><em>With all my love,
Dianne</em></p>
