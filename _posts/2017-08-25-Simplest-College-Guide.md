Why are summers so short and school years so long? I’m sure you’re feeling a little sad about summer being over, a little nervous with a dash of excitement for the new school year to commence or you just don’t know how to feel right now and that’s okay too. I get it.

School actually began 4 days ago for me and I’m here to share with you the simplest college guide yet.

I used to overpack when I first started college. I brought too much with me and here I am, with a hurting neck and back. I couldn’t figure out how to college for the longest time either. I didn’t know how to study the right way, organize my notes, etc.

You probably stumbled upon this blog because you just don’t know where to begin or you’ve been doing college and you just couldn’t figure out how to make your life easier. I’m here to help you out with that or at least share with you what I’ve done to keep my college life less stressful.

Let’s face it, the more stuff you have to look after, the more unorganized you’ll eventually be, the more stress you’re going to get. College is stressful and if you could help yourself out, this would be one of the ways to go about it. At least I think so.

Only carry what you need in your backpack. To me, here’s a list of what I need and why I need it.

# HEADPHONES
I can listen to music on my walk to class. This also helps if you don’t want other students stopping you on your way to class ;). Headphones are also amazing for when you’re studying, but you already knew that!

# EMERGENCY KIT
If you’re a girl, you’re going to need to house your tampons, extra hair ties, etc. You don’t want to be that lady who has to dig into her backpack to find the girl stuff.

# WALLET (w/money)
I don’t recommend spending all your money on food in college (trust me, it gets expensive), but it’s always nice to have that cash on hand for when friends want to do an impromptu lunch or when you’re running out of gas. Although money is great, so is identification, so always always bring your wallet with your ID in it because you might just get a discount on your next purchase.

# WATER BOTTLE
Honestly, I wish I did this the first day of college. Don’t underestimate the size of your campus. You are going to be walking across campus all day to your classes and when your schedule only allows 10 minutes break between classes, you’re not going to have enough time to stand in line and grab a drink. Also, it’s just a good rule of thumb to always hydrate throughout the day.

# SNACKS
Classes can be 50 minutes long or 3 hours and it gets boring and then you get sleepy, sometimes though, you are going to be hungry. Bring some snacks with you, put it in a ziploc. A few favorite snacks of mine are trail mix and fruits. This will also help you minimize spending.

# CHARGER
Whatever device you’re carrying with you, always carry a corresponding charger! Need i say more?

# NOTEBOOK/LOOSE LEAF/WRITING UTENSIL OR IPAD/LAPTOP
Go to class, take notes, then study them.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Now, I’m going to share some college hacks I’ve picked up and implemented in my own life.

### Pick up a 3 or 5 subject notebook.
I’ve done the folder system, the laptop system, probably every system out there, but nothing beats using what you already know. For this semester, I picked up a 3 subject notebook which will house 3 different classes. I find this easy and simple because I only have to remember to grab one notebook instead of three others.

### Pick up a stand-a-lone notebook.
If you’re taking a math class. Couldn’t I just buy a 5 subject notebook and house math in there too, so I only really have to remember to grab one notebook? Well, you could, but I don’t recommend it. Personally, as a computer science student, I find it easier to have all my math notes/homework in one place. I don’t like mixing it with any other classes because it’s a subject that requires more attention and practice and quite frankly, more space. I’m also super distracted, so when its time to study I prefer only having my math notebook around me because if I mix it with the others, I will MOST LIKELY review the other ones because I mean… MATH, it’s not really a subject I enjoy.

### Use a planner, but use your phone too.
Anything you put in your planner, should be inputted in your phone too. But… that’s too much work!!! Well, when was the last time you left your phone at home? When was the last time you left your planner/notebook at home? You know where I’m going with this. There are a lot of apps to help you out with this, but since I have an iPhone, I just have my google calendar connected to apple’s calendar. Take some time out of your Sunday to update these.

### Create a master syllabus.
When you finally receive your syllabi, create a master syllabus using excel. Input due dates and assignments for every class, sort it by date. Double check and make sure every due date and assignment corresponds to the right class.

### Study the night before.
Study the night before. If it’s a math class, study what you’re about to learn the next class. This will make your life so much easier! You’ll know what you’re about to cover and you can spend your next class asking questions and reinforcing what you’ve learned!

### PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE
