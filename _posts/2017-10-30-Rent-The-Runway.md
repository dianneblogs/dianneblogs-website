Hi gals!

For the past two years, I’ve worn the same black dress to events. I’ve shopped about two times in the last year and my wardrobe consists of blacks (a lot of blacks) and neutrals. This past weekend, we celebrated our friends Jamilah and Ray’s marriage and for the first time, I really didn’t want to wear the same black dress. Figures.

I haven’t bought a dress in a long time because my body keeps changing. I get extremely frustrated trying on dresses and it just doesn’t fit in certain areas. When a dress doesn’t fit, I resort to either ditching the event or buying a new one. As a college student, it is extremely hard to pay for a well-made dress. I just don’t want to pay for a dress I will only wear once. I mean, you understand, right? 

One day, I decided to explore my app store. Who would have thought shopping for dresses these days involved an app store? I found apps I’ve used before like Poshmark, then I stumbled upon Rent The Runway. Honestly, it sounded enticing. I could never afford Runway clothes, but what the heck - let's give it a try.

I looked through the app, saved some dresses in my account for future events, but never used it until this past week. 

Rent The Runway: A College Girl’s Dream

Like I mentioned, I attended my friend’s wedding this past weekend.I rented the dress I wore and I felt comfortable in it. I felt like a million bucks. I felt put together. I felt beautiful in it.

I rented this dress for 4 days. Scheduled the delivery to my parent’s house on Friday, 27 October 2017, but arrived on Thursday, 26 October 2017. 
A week before the wedding, the rental price was around $30-$45, so I waited until the weekend before to rent it. When I checked back, the rental price went down to $30, so SCORE! 

**Here’s a breakdown of my rental in US Dollars**
```python
Dress Rental - 30
Insurance - 5
Shipping - 9.95
Return - Included (but they say FREE)
Estimated Taxes - 2.30
--------------------------------
Order Total: 47.25
```
Honestly, not bad considering this rental cost $258 in retail. On top of this, I thought I was only renting the size I picked out, but you get an additional size for FREE. Picking the size was fairly easy. If you’re like me and the dress or dresses you currently own only have S,M,L instead of numbers - RTR makes it easy for you find the perfect dress and size. You can put in your height, size and look through reviews (if available) from people who are of your same height, body type, etc. I originally ordered a size 2 and picked a size 4 as my extra just to make sure. I fit in the 4 comfortably, but size 2 was the perfect size and that’s what I wore at the wedding.

What came in the mail was a garment bag with two dresses (the same, but different sizes), however, you do get an option to have an additional dress (different) instead of an additional size for extra cost. A return mailing label is also included. 

Insurance covers stains, slight rips (you know, the accidental stuff). I didn’t have to worry about dry cleaning at all, too. All you have to do is put it back in the garment bag after you’re done and drop it off at any UPS store before noon on your return date. Easy! 

The dress looked exactly like the image on the app and it is definitely very well made!
