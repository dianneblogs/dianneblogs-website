Hi gals! Okay, girl talk. Do you ever have anything to wear to an event? I never do. In the last two years, I've probably only shopped for a dress like twice, ever. Everytime I have an event to attend to, I wear the same dress. Sometimes, I feel as if everyone's starting to notice that I'm wearing the same dress over and over again and sometimes, the dress I have on hand for any event won't fit anymore (sad face). 

For a couple of years now, I've been playing around with the idea of renting a dress because if I'm being realistic, I only wear it once, I spend too much money on it and have a hard time letting go because of it's "sentimental value". 

This past weekend, I wore my very first RENTED dress from RENT THE RUNWAY (find it in your app store!) and I'm honestly so impressed and satisfied.
