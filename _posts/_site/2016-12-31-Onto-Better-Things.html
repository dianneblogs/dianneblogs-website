<p>Wow, first time being single in three years! I welcomed 2016 with some of my closest friends. We had such a blast (no pun intended) and I am very grateful to have them in my life.</p>

<p>Fun Fact: We have all been friends since middle school!</p>

<p>Well… this month was a shock. I met this guy around February (maybe end of January) through the connect group I joined at my church. He turned out to be the guy I prayed for. He loves Jesus, an engineering major, serving in the military (what the heck! how did this even happen??).</p>

<p>I know, I know, I have high standards.</p>

<p>Anyway, George and I went to the annual Chocolate Coffee Festival (we were only friends at the time). He was straight to the point and the rest is history.</p>

<p>I turned 21! My first “legal” drink was wine, in a speakeasy, with my parents. I guess you can tell I am not ready to be an adult lol.</p>

<p>George and I went on our first major trip to <em>drum roll, please</em>…
the Pacific Northwest! It was a trip I wanted to take on my own, but the protective man that he is… he took time off and came with me. We visited with my grandparents in Portland and explored Washington.</p>

<p>This is also intern month. So… I’m positive I spent more time with my colleagues from my internship more than my family &amp; new boyfriend.</p>

<p>Lots of lessons learned with it comes to college. This was an incredibly rough semester.</p>

<h3 id="5-things-i-was-told-but-didnt-listen-or-follow">5 things I was told, but didn’t listen or follow:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Do not take two math classes per semester. If you’re genius, discard comment.</li>
  <li>Do not take two or more engineering courses. Again, discard if you’re smart.</li>
  <li>Be organized. Be freaking overly organized.</li>
  <li>Don’t forget to eat!</li>
  <li>Always hydrate</li>
</ol>

<p>I spent Christmas 2016 in Kansas and left for Spain two days later to spend New Years in Madrid with my travel buddy, Kirsten!</p>

<p>Seriously, one of the best years I’ve had in a long time. Eternally grateful to God who made sure that everything fell right into place at the right time. I’m onto better things and this is only the beginning.</p>

<p>Watch out 2017, can’t wait to fill you with more memories!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An amazing thing happens when you get honest with yourself and start doing what you love, what makes you happy. Your life literally slows down. You stop wishing for the weekend. You stop merely looking forward to special events. You begin to live in each moment and you start feeling like a human being. You just ride the wave that is life, with this feeling of contentment and joy. You move fluidly, steadily, calm, and grateful. A veil is lifted, and a whole new perspective is born.</p>
