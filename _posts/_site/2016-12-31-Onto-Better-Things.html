<p>Wow, first time being single in three years! I welcomed 2016 with some of my closest friends. We had such a blast (no pun intended) and I am very grateful to have them in my life.</p>

<p>Fun Fact: We have all been friends since middle school!</p>

<p>Well… this month was a shock. I met this guy around February (maybe end of January) through the connect group I joined at my church. He turned out to be the guy I prayed for. He loves Jesus, an engineering major, serving in the military (what the heck! how did this even happen??).</p>

<p>I know, I know, I have high standards.</p>

<p>Anyway, George and I went to the annual Chocolate Coffee Festival (we were only friends at the time). He was straight to the point and the rest is history.</p>

<p>I turned 21! My first “legal” drink was wine, in a speakeasy, with my parents. I guess you can tell I am not ready to be an adult lol.</p>
