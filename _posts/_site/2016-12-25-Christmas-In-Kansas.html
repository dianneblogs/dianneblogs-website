<p>Three days before Christmas 2016, G and I left Albuquerque to spend Christmas with his family in Kansas. We left around 21:00, making it the best decision ever because we missed all the weather!</p>

<p>I was up for some introductions on this trip as G comes from a family of 10. I was so nervous, I screamed in the car as we were pulling in the driveway. G laughed as always. I had no idea how this was going to go, but all G told me was to be myself, so I did. When we walked into the house, all the nerves went away. I guess everyone was also nervous to meet me! Can you believe that? So relieved.</p>

<p>We spent the afternoon talking and telling stories until all of (kids) left for dinner. We went to Walt‘s diner for dinner. Then, we went to Life Church Wichita for a Christmas service.</p>

<p>Next day, I met Sally (G‘s younger sister). She‘s a certified nursing assistant and she loves it. We went to Egg Crate for breakfast and I swear, that place is sooooo good. When it was time for dinner, G took me to Picasso‘s Pizza where I ate the most gigantour slice of pizza EVER. After dinner, we visited his good friend, James.</p>

<p>On Christmas Eve, G and I went to Emperor (Chinese Restaurant) for brunch. Something I love about Kansas is how good and inexpensive asian food is! I‘m talking $6 with a drink! Right after brunch, we went to Sedgwick County Park and fed the squirrels! In the afternoon, G took me on a 30 minute walk by the lake in his parent‘s neighborhood. So sweet (swoon).</p>

<p>When the clock struck 12:01, pure madness overloaded the house. Everyone opened their presents and most received what they asked for. I didn‘t expect much since it‘s my first time metting his family, but so grateful for everything they gave me.</p>

<p>Christmas day was spent hanging out with friends and family!</p>
