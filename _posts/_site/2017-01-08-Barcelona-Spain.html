<p>My bestfriend, Kirsten and I shared a room with four other girls during our stay at Casa Gracia. It was a little awkward in the beginning because everyone was too jet lagged for introductions. We shared a shower/bathroom, but had our own individual single beds. For a hostel room that accomodated 6, I have to say, it was spacious and cute!</p>

<p>My favorite part about the hostel stay was: breakfast :heart_eyes:
Breakfast is COMPLIMENTARY and I swear, no lie: This has got to be the breakfast of the champs! Fresh squeezed orange juice, coffee, tea, chocolate filled croissants (my favorite!), sausages, eggs, toast, you name it. They even provided cute to-go cups for your drink.</p>

<p>Barcelona was a blast. We started with a walking tour of Barcelona and visited Catedral de Barcelona and Boqueria.</p>

<p>Balthazar hosted our very first dinner in Spain (so courses galore).</p>

<p>I don’t think I’ve drank as much as I did in Spain. We visited fun bars. The first bar we went to was called Dow Jones Bar, basically, it is a drink exchange bar. My beer was only two euros. Really worth the visit. Super laid back and people were nice and the best part? People were not the creepy type of nice.</p>
