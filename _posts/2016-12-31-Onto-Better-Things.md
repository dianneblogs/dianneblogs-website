# January

Wow, first time being single in three years! I welcomed 2016 with some of my closest friends. We had such a blast (no pun intended) and I am very grateful to have them in my life. 

Fun Fact: We have all been friends since middle school!

# March

Well... this month was a shock. I met this guy around February (maybe end of January) through the connect group I joined at my church. He turned out to be the guy I prayed for. He loves Jesus, an engineering major, serving in the military (what the heck! how did this even happen??). 

I know, I know, I have high standards.

Anyway, George and I went to the annual Chocolate Coffee Festival (we were only friends at the time). He was straight to the point and the rest is history.

# May

I turned 21! My first &#8220;legal&#8221; drink was wine, in a speakeasy, with my parents. I guess you can tell I am not ready to be an adult lol.
