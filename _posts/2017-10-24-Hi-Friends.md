Hi Friends! It's been awhile since I last blogged.

And!!!! If you haven't noticed :) Welcome to Dianneblogs! I've worked so hard on this blog and I've learned so much in the process. Just heads up, the owner of the theme I'm using is currently working on some page features. You'll notice that when you first come to dianneblogs.com, there is an "older" and "newer" button on the very bottom, but non-existent on any of the tabs... so, yeah - bear with me(us?). Each tab should be updated with its corresponding post category and if you want to go "home", just hit "blog" (like I said, no older and newer buttons, yet). Oh! Don't click on the header image to go "home", it won't take you anywhere... (i know, need to work on the user-friendliness) and you'll just hate that you even thought about doing that.

You all know, I blog as much as I can, but not very often and although I've learned a lot about deploying a website, it was still a lot of work and there is still a lot to learn. I'm hoping it gets better as time goes. Anyway, enjoy your time here and I'm so happy I finally get to share this with you!!

*Disclaimer: I only transferred what I thought/felt was important from  dianneblogs.wordpress.com. Other than that, the rest are archived and I get to create new content for you!*

**Now onto updates because who doesn't love an update?**   

First of all, I am so happy many of you found my last post relatable. It brought me so much comfort that I can be vulnerable and share with you such experience and I am so happy to be there for those who are currently experiencing a similar situation. Thank you for reading, your comments meant the world to me.

Anyway, I guess it's time for an update! I don't know about you, but I truly enjoy reading what people have been up to with their lives. It's all so interesting and some, relatable - for sure.

There's many reasons why I haven't blogged and I don't think any of it is a shocker. As you all may know (or don't know) I'm currently in Computer Science school. It takes up so much of my days and more. I am so set to do well this semester, so it's only fitting to prioritize that over my blog.

Two weeks ago, we celebrated our friend's Bridal Shower! She's getting married in 8 days and we're so excited for her. Weeks and definitely the night before the bridal shower, I had the opportunity to help my sister (from another mister) get all the final touches for our friend's bridal shower. Let me know if you'd like a post on how we went about giving her a bridal shower party!

A week ago, I spent most of my time studying for exams and when exams were over for the week, I was FINALLY able to go to the Balloon Fiesta! Balloon Fiesta happens every year and if you saw my Instagram story, it's basically a lot of hot air balloons in the air! Honest truth, probably the only exciting thing to ever happen in Albuquerque.

Then, I was back to having back to back exams the following week. I know, exciting.

Anyway, last Friday morning I was in a meeting with the founder and co-founder of the organization I'm interning for in January! I am so passionate about this and I could explain it all to you right now the who, what's, when, and where's and how, but I feel like that's something that deserves a post by itself. I've been a volunteer for almost two years now and I am just overjoyed to be able to serve as an intern next year. I am so humbled that they have chosen me, trusted me, to take this position, work in a team, lead others and grow. I know with this position, I will be more prone to spiritual attacks, so I ask of you: Can you please keep me in your prayers? I've experienced spiritual attacks before and let me tell you, they are draining and awful.

As always, thank you so much for reading, for caring, and for being nosey about my life! I hope you all are doing amazing!! Strive for the best and God will take care of the rest :)


Love y'all,
Dianne
