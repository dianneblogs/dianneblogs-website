# DOT INTRODUCTION
 *Daughter of the King. Coffee Drinker. Comp Sci Major. Adventurer.*

Hi there! Nice to meet you! My [middle] name is Dianne. I am so glad you are here.

Welcome to Dianne Blogs: **a mixture of everything and in betweens of my life.**

This wouldn't be an "about me page" if I don't tell you a few things about myself.

### Believer
I love Jesus. I personally think He's the best bestfriend anyone could ever have. I love that He's forgiving, He listens, He knows what's best for me.

### College Student
I'm a college student, studying Computer Science. I enjoy coding in: *Python*, *Java*, *Web Dev*

### Fun Fact
I was born and raised in the Philippines. If you look at a map of the Philippines, I lived in the island that looks like a sock! It was beautiful and laid back!

### Relationship
I am so in love with my SO, **George**. He is such an amazing human being. He brings out the best in me.

If you want to know more, don't hesitate to ask!
