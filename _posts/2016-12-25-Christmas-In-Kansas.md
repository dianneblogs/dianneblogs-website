Three days before Christmas 2016, G and I left Albuquerque to spend Christmas with his family in Kansas. We left around 21:00, making it the best decision ever because we missed all the weather!

I was up for some introductions on this trip as G comes from a family of 10. I was so nervous, I screamed in the car as we were pulling in the driveway. G laughed as always. I had no idea how this was going to go, but all G told me was to be myself, so I did. When we walked into the house, all the nerves went away. I guess everyone was also nervous to meet me! Can you believe that? So relieved.

We spent the afternoon talking and telling stories until all of (kids) left for dinner. We went to Walt&#8216;s diner for dinner. Then, we went to Life Church Wichita for a Christmas service.

Next day, I met Sally (G&#8216;s younger sister). She&#8216;s a certified nursing assistant and she loves it. We went to Egg Crate for breakfast and I swear, that place is sooooo good. When it was time for dinner, G took me to Picasso&#8216;s Pizza where I ate the most gigantour slice of pizza EVER. After dinner, we visited his good friend, James.

On Christmas Eve, G and I went to Emperor (Chinese Restaurant) for brunch. Something I love about Kansas is how good and inexpensive asian food is! I&#8216;m talking $6 with a drink! Right after brunch, we went to Sedgwick County Park and fed the squirrels! In the afternoon, G took me on a 30 minute walk by the lake in his parent&#8216;s neighborhood. So sweet (swoon).

When the clock struck 12:01, pure madness overloaded the house. Everyone opened their presents and most received what they asked for. I didn&#8216;t expect much since it&#8216;s my first time metting his family, but so grateful for everything they gave me.

Christmas day was spent hanging out with friends and family!
