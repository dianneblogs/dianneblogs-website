Hi Friends! It's been awhile since I last blogged. 

First of all, I am so happy many of you found my last post relatable. It brought me so much comfort that I can be vulnerable and share with you such experience and I am so happy to be there for those who are currently experiencing a similar situation. Thank you for reading, your comments meant the world to me. 

Anyway, I guess it's time for an update! I don't know about you, but I truly enjoy reading what people have been up to with their lives. It's all so interesting and some, relatable - for sure. 

There's many reasons why I haven't blogged and I don't think any of it is a shocker. As you all may know (or don't know) I'm currently in Computer Science school. It takes up so much of my days and more. I am so set to do well this semester, so it's only fitting to prioritize that over my blog. 

Two weeks ago, we celebrated our friend's Bridal Shower! She's getting married in 8 days and we're so excited for her. Weeks and definitely the night before the bridal shower, I had the opportunity to help my sister (from another mister) get all the final touches for our friend's bridal shower. Let me know if you'd like a post on how we went about giving her a bridal shower party! 

A week ago, I spent most of my time studying for exams and when exams were over for the week, I was FINALLY able to go to the Balloon Fiesta! Balloon Fiesta happens every year and if you saw my Instagram story, it's basically a lot of hot air balloons in the air! 

Then, I was back to having back to back exams the following week. I know, exciting. 

Fast-forward to today. George left this morning for Texas for an awards ceremony. He will either be back early tomorrow morning or ... I really don't know (you go where the military tells you to go). 

Anyway, this morning I was in a meeting with the founder and co-founder of the organization I'm interning for in January! I am so passionate about this and I could explain it all to you right now the who, what's, when, and where's and how, but I feel like that's something that deserves a post by itself. But, I've been a volunteer for almost two years now and I am just overjoyed to be able to serve as an intern next year. I am so humbled that they have chosen me, trusted me, to take this position, work in a team, lead others and grow. I know with this position, I will be more prone to spiritual attacks, so I ask of you: Can you please keep me in your prayers? I've experienced spiritual attacks before and let me tell you, they are draining and awful. 

As always, thank you so much for reading, for caring, and for being nosey about my life! I hope you all are doing amazing!! Strive for the best and God will take care of the rest :)

Love y'all, 
Dianne
